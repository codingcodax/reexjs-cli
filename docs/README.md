## What it is ℹ️

[ReexJs CLI](https://github.com/a12989x/reexjs-cli) is an interactive CLI that automates the process of creating a React / Next App.
Usually developers we spent a lot of time installing dependencies, creating folders, etc., before having our initial configuration and start working on the application.

The goal of [ReexJs CLI](https://github.com/a12989x/reexjs-cli) It is that we can start working on our application without worrying about the initial configuration.
